To compile lock, type:

	xmkmf
	make

you should have a "lock" binary in the current directory.

You may get an error at the link stage complaining about
an undefined reference to the function `crypt' in password.o:
this probably means you're running a recent free Unix. for
some reason, these split the crypt function out of libc and
into its own library, libcrypt. Either correct the generated
makefile by adding -lcrypt to the libraries to be linked
against or -- this is probably the easier option -- reissue
the failed command, but add -lcrypt to the end.
